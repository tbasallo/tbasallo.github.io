                <h2>Toolshed</h2>
                <p>Below are a few topics that are high on my list. Before you read them, please read the 
                    <a href="about.html">about page</a> to gain a little insight into the thought process and intent behind toolshed. I'll update this 
                    list as things get updated and change.
                </p>
                <h3>Extensions</h3>
                <p>Toolshed makes heavy use of extensions. In fact, it could almost be called an extension library.
                    I love extensions. If you do not like extensions (or even hate and detest with the passion of a thousand suns),
                     you may not want to use this particular library. The war will continue to rage with good points made on either
                     side and I am not preaching here that way is the One Right Way
                </p>
                <h3>XML Comments</h3>
                <p>I am trying to add comments to all methods to better understand what methods do.
                    I find this esecially important since we discover so much usiing Mighty Intellisense. Of course,
                    this is in addition to what gets documented here.
                </p>
                <h3>Testing</h3>
                <p>Since this is a library, I really want to include good tests and aim for high code coverage.
                    I am not 100% convinced on a TDD (please don't berrate me), but I do want to provide users as much 
                    peace of mind as possible. So, testing will be a focus point going forward.
                </p>
                <h3>Culture</h3>
                <p>This library was started 10 years ago (maybe more?) and when I first started I didn;t even know what
                    CultureInfo was and how it impacted anything in the dev world. I now know better, but that being true, this 
                    library currently has a North American/English bias. I hope that that will be corrected with time where it makes sense.
                </p>
                <p>I have done very little work using different cultures (save some Spanish), so this will be new territory for me.</p>
                <h3>Community - PRs &amp; Issues</h3>
                <p>Last but definitely not least is the topic of contributions in the way of issues and PRs. This is now
                    an open source project and in the spirit of what that represents i look forward to help from the community in the way issues being reported and PRs
                    being submitted.
