        <h2>toolshed - the history </h2>
        <p>I created Toolshed (or Webchanix.Toolshed) probably 10 or so years ago. Probably more. I forget.
            I started working on it because every project I worked on needed the same type
            of functions. Again. And. Again.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dates. Oh my dates. Dates were probably the main reason toolshed even became a thought. 
            Like many developers (I am sure of it) dates are constantly being messed with (at least in LOB applications).
            Adding, subtracting, start of the month, end of the month, last month, next month, YTD, MTD, start of the day, 
            end of the day, so on and so forth.
        </p>
        <p>Then it was with dates. Then booleans. And it made sense to keep adding things to this library - because it madelife easy.
            So much easier. Then we got extension methods and life really became easy because now you could do things like <code>DateTime.Today.EndOfDay()</code>
            and BOOM! you end up with <code>7/4/2011 23:59:59</code> - how sweet is that?
        </p>
        <p>Fats forward 10 years of dev work and one continues reading how blogging and participating in the open source community
            is important for personal development and for the overall goodness of our industry.
        </p>
        <p>My first attempt to "open source" Toolshed was under <strong>Webchanix.Toolshed</strong> and it was at the now defunct code.msdn.com. 
        It got some downloads, can't remember how many, and some comments - mostly around culture - a German user if I remember correctly.
    And that's what I first encountered cultures and the impact on numbers and dates.</p>
