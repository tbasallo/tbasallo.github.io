        <h2>toolshed - the history </h2>
        <p>I created Toolshed (or Webchanix.Toolshed) probably 15 or so years ago. Probably more. I forget.
            I started working on it because every project I worked on needed the same type
            of functions. Again. And. Again.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dates. Oh my dates. Dates were probably the main reason toolshed even became a thought. 
            Like many developers (I am sure of it) dates are constantly being messed with (at least in LOB applications).
            Adding, subtracting, start of the month, end of the month, last month, next month, YTD, MTD, start of the day, 
            end of the day, so on and so forth.
        </p>
        <p>Then it was with dates. Then booleans. And it made sense to keep adding things to this library - because it made life easy.
            So much easier. Then we got extension methods and life really became easy because now you could do things like <code>DateTime.Today.EndOfDay()</code>
            and BOOM! you end up with <code>7/4/2011 23:59:59</code> - how sweet is that?
        </p>
        <p>Fast forward 15 years of working in the world of developers, programmers, software engineers, designers, coders, code monkeys and 
            any other adjetive (good and bad) to describe those that do what we do (and if you're into this library - you know what that is).
            The concept of blogging and contributing to open source is a huge thing. Professionally and personally. The impact of these two 
            things (and there are other things of course) on personal development is great and plus the overall goodnes for the community/industry
            at large.
        </p>
        <p>Blogging is my personal cross to bear - but we'll move beyond that topic here.</p>
        <p>My first attempt to "open source" Toolshed (or anything for that matter) was under <strong>Webchanix.Toolshed</strong> and it was 
            at the now defunct code.msdn.com. It got some downloads, can't remember how many, and some comments - mostly around culture - a German user if I remember correctly.
    And that's when I first encountered cultures and the impact on numbers and dates. And, for the record, I haven't done a good enough job 
integrating cultures into toolshed. Maybe now that can be rectified. Maybe with others' help. Or not.</p>
<p>So this attempt, officially starting at version 7 will be the final attempt (should anyone ever talk in absolutes?) at open sourcing this 
    library and making it prepetually available GitHub.
</p>
<p>Why now? Why finally after all this time? Because it's about time. Better sooner than later. I want to provide something back. Because I read 
    blog post after blog post, or look at library after library and I realize that there's an actual need (by some) for something like this. Not 
    everyone has stitched together a library for all these common things that we do. So, there's a need, however minor, that can benefit from this 
    work as much as I have benefited from other OSS projects. My tiny contribution.
</p>
<p>A few things that v7 will do versus previous versions. I will break out some of the more esoteric functions. As I go through the code I've realized 
    I have only used some of the helpers in one project, eight years ago, do I really need to have that there? Also, things not supported by .net core 2.0 
    which I'm already moving to. Things like configuration. My ASP.NET projects use/access config a lot. A lot. And I have a whole lot
    of code around working with configs - default values when null, strongly-typed values (int, date, etc.), lists from config - those kind of things. 
    That's no longer needed in .net core 2 (in v1?) since we can strongly type a config and have it injected into your classes. There will be a 
    use in some cases where dependency injection is not possible or desired. In this case accessing a config (xml) or appsettings (json) will be 
    needed, but I think adding it to a separate package will be best. But things can change in v8 :P
